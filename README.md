# better-auth.go

This package is a port of the popular [better-auth]() library in Go. Most of the features in better-auth are equivalent in Go, but implementations may differ.

The goal is to have a drop-in authentication package that can:
- be easily configured for multiple authentication use cases
- is self-contained
- works with plugins and across multiple database providers 
- at the bare minimum, can work in-memory


This is NOT an official library.
